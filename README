NAME
    Gearman::Driver - Manages Gearman workers

SYNOPSIS
        package My::Workers::One;

        # Yes, you need to do it exactly this way
        use base qw(Gearman::Driver::Worker);
        use Moose;

        # this method will be registered with gearmand as 'My::Workers::One::scale_image'
        sub scale_image : Job {
            my ( $self, $job, $workload ) = @_;
            # do something
        }

        # this method will be registered with gearmand as 'My::Workers::One::do_something_else'
        sub do_something_else : Job : MinProcesses(2) : MaxProcesses(15) {
            my ( $self, $job, $workload ) = @_;
            # do something
        }

        # this method wont be registered with gearmand at all
        sub do_something_internal {
            my ( $self, $job, $workload ) = @_;
            # do something
        }

        1;

        package My::Workers::Two;

        use base qw(Gearman::Driver::Worker);
        use Moose;

        # this method will be registered with gearmand as 'My::Workers::Two::scale_image'
        sub scale_image : Job {
            my ( $self, $job, $workload ) = @_;
            # do something
        }

        1;

        package main;

        use Gearman::Driver;

        my $driver = Gearman::Driver->new(
            namespaces => [qw(My::Workers)],
            server     => 'localhost:4730,otherhost:4731',
            interval   => 60,
        );

        $driver->run;

DESCRIPTION
    Having hundreds of Gearman workers running in separate processes can
    consume a lot of RAM. Often many of these workers share the same
    code/objects, like the database layer using DBIx::Class for example.
    This is where Gearman::Driver comes in handy:

    You write some base class which inherits from Gearman::Driver::Worker.
    Your base class loads your database layer for example. Each of your
    worker classes inherit from that base class. In the worker classes you
    can register single methods as jobs with gearmand. It's even possible to
    control how many workers doing that job/method in parallel. And this is
    the point where you'll save some RAM: Instead of starting each worker in
    a separate process Gearman::Driver will fork each worker from the main
    process. This will take advantage of copy-on-write on Linux and save
    some RAM.

    There's only one mandatory parameter which has to be set when calling
    the constructor: namespaces

        use Gearman::Driver;
        my $driver = Gearman::Driver->new( namespaces => [qw(My::Workers)] );

    See also: namespaces. If you do not set server (gearmand) attribute the
    default will be used: "localhost:4730"

    Each module found in your namespaces will be loaded and introspected,
    looking for methods having the 'Job' attribute set:

        package My::Workers::ONE;

        sub scale_image : Job {
            my ( $self, $job, $workload ) = @_;
            # do something
        }

    This method will be registered as job function with gearmand, verify it
    by doing:

        plu@mbp ~$ telnet localhost 4730
        Trying ::1...
        Connected to localhost.
        Escape character is '^]'.
        status
        My::Workers::ONE::scale_image   0       0       1
        .
        ^]
        telnet> Connection closed.

    If you dont like to use the full package name you can also specify a
    custom prefix:

        package My::Workers::ONE;

        sub prefix { 'foo_bar_' }

        sub scale_image : Job {
            my ( $self, $job, $workload ) = @_;
            # do something
        }

    This would register 'foo_bar_scale_image' with gearmand.

    See also: prefix

ATTRIBUTES
    See also "ATTRIBUTES" in Gearman::Driver::Loader.

  server
    A list of Gearman servers the workers should connect to. The format for
    the server list is: "host[:port][,host[:port]]"

    See also: Gearman::XS

    * default: "localhost:4730"
    * isa: "Str"

  console_port
    Gearman::Driver has a telnet management console, see also:

    Gearman::Driver::Console

    * default: 47300
    * isa: "Int"

    Set this to 0 to disable management console at all.

  interval
    Each n seconds Net::Telnet::Gearman is used in Gearman::Driver::Observer
    to check status of free/running/busy workers on gearmand. This is used
    to fork more workers depending on the queue size and the
    MinProcesses/MaxProcesses attribute of the job method. See also:
    Gearman::Driver::Worker

    * default: 5
    * isa: "Int"

  max_idle_time
    Whenever Gearman::Driver::Observer notices that there are more processes
    running than actually necessary (depending on min_processes and
    max_processes setting) it will kill them. By default this happens
    immediately. If you change this value to 300, a process which is not
    necessary is killed after 300 seconds.

    Please remember that this also depends on what value you set "interval"
    to. The max_idle_time is only checked each n seconds where n is
    "interval". Besides that it makes only sense when you have workers where
    "MinProcesses" in Gearman::Driver::Worker is set to 0.

    * default: 0
    * isa: "Int"

  logfile
    Path to logfile.

    * isa: "Str"
    * default: "gearman_driver.log"

  loglayout
    See also Log::Log4perl.

    * isa: "Str"
    * default: "[%d] %p %m%n"

  loglevel
    See also Log::Log4perl.

    * isa: "Str"
    * default: "INFO"

  unknown_job_callback
    Whenever Gearman::Driver::Observer sees a job that isnt handled it will
    call this CodeRef, passing following arguments:

    * $driver
    * $status

        my $driver = Gearman::Driver->new(
            namespaces           => [qw(My::Workers)],
            unknown_job_callback => sub {
                my ( $driver, $status ) = @_;
                # notify nagios here for example
            }
        );

    $status might look like:

        $VAR1 = {
            'busy'    => 0,
            'free'    => 0,
            'name'    => 'GDExamples::Convert::unknown_job',
            'queue'   => 6,
            'running' => 0
        };

INTERNAL ATTRIBUTES
    This might be interesting for subclassing Gearman::Driver.

  jobs
    Stores all Gearman::Driver::Job instances. The key is the name the job
    gets registered with gearmand. There are also two methods: get_job and
    has_job.

    Example:

        {
            'My::Workers::ONE::scale_image'       => bless( {...}, 'Gearman::Driver::Job' ),
            'My::Workers::ONE::do_something_else' => bless( {...}, 'Gearman::Driver::Job' ),
            'My::Workers::TWO::scale_image'       => bless( {...}, 'Gearman::Driver::Job' ),
        }

    * isa: "HashRef"
    * readonly: "True"

  observer
    Instance of Gearman::Driver::Observer.

    * isa: "Gearman::Driver::Observer"
    * readonly: "True"

  console
    Instance of Gearman::Driver::Console.

    * isa: "Gearman::Driver::Console"
    * readonly: "True"

  extended_status
    Enables/disables extended status information in management console like
    lastrun, lasterror and lasterror_msg.

    * isa: "Bool"
    * default: 1

METHODS
  add_job
    There's one mandatory param (hashref) with following keys:

    * decode (optionally)
        Name of a decoder method in your worker object.

    * encode (optionally)
        Name of a encoder method in your worker object.

    * method (mandatory)
        Reference to a CodeRef which will get invoked.

    * min_processes (mandatory)
        Minimum number of processes that should be forked.

    * max_processes (mandatory)
        Maximum number of processes that may be forked.

    * name (mandatory)
        Job name/alias that method should be registered with Gearman.

    * object (mandatory)
        Object that should be passed as first parameter to the job method.

    Basically you never really need this method if you use "namespaces". But
    "namespaces" depend on method attributes which some people do hate. In
    this case, feel free to setup your $driver this way:

        package My::Workers::One;

        use Moose;
        use JSON::XS;
        extends 'Gearman::Driver::Worker::Base';

        sub scale_image {
            my ( $self, $job, $workload ) = @_;
            # do something
        }

        # this method will be registered with gearmand as 'My::Workers::One::do_something_else'
        sub do_something_else {
            my ( $self, $job, $workload ) = @_;
            # do something
        }

        sub encode_json {
            my ( $self, $result ) = @_;
            return JSON::XS::encode_json($result);
        }

        sub decode_json {
            my ( $self, $workload ) = @_;
            return JSON::XS::decode_json($workload);
        }

        1;

        package main;

        use Gearman::Driver;
        use My::Workers::One;

        my $driver = Gearman::Driver->new(
            server   => 'localhost:4730,otherhost:4731',
            interval => 60,
        );

        my $worker = My::Workers::One->new();

        foreach my $method (qw(scale_image do_something_else)) {
            $driver->add_job(
                decode        => 'decode_json',
                encode        => 'encode_json',
                max_processes => 5,
                method        => $worker->meta->find_method_by_name($method)->body,
                min_processes => 1,
                name          => $method,
                object        => $worker,
            );
        }

        $driver->run;

  get_jobs
    Returns all Gearman::Driver::Job objects ordered by jobname.

  run
    This must be called after the Gearman::Driver object is instantiated.

  shutdown
    Sends TERM signal to all child processes and exits Gearman::Driver.

  has_job
    Params: $name

    Returns true/false if the job exists.

  get_job
    Params: $name

    Returns the job instance.

SCRIPT
    There's also a script "gearman_driver.pl" which is installed with this
    distribution. It just instantiates Gearman::Driver with its default
    values, having most of the options exposed to the command line using
    MooseX::Getopt.

        usage: gearman_driver.pl [long options...]
                --loglevel          Log level (default: INFO)
                --lib               Example: --lib ./lib --lib /custom/lib
                --server            Gearman host[:port][,host[:port]]
                --logfile           Path to logfile (default: gearman_driver.log)
                --console_port      Port of management console (default: 47300)
                --interval          Interval in seconds (see Gearman::Driver::Observer)
                --loglayout         Log message layout (default: [%d] %p %m%n)
                --namespaces        Example: --namespaces My::Workers --namespaces My::OtherWorkers
